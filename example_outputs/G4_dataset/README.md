Outputs of running example dataset evaluation

```bash
evaluate_dataset \
  --input example_datasets/G4_positives.fasta example_datasets/G4_negatives.fasta \
  --format fasta \
  --out_folder example_outputs/G4_dataset
```

Running the above commands for `evaluate_dataset` tool will create `example_outputs/G4_dataset` folder with the following results:
- `dataset_report_label_G4_positives_vs_G4_negatives.csv` - simple report with the results (pass/fail) of the evaluation between two classes of the dataset.
- `dataset_report_label_G4_positives_vs_G4_negatives.html` - visul report with the results of the evaluation between two classes of the dataset. 
  - It contains basic information about the dataset and plots visualizing individual features of the dataset. 
  - Each plot can be toned with red color, meaning the specific feature was too different between the two dataset classes and should be examined.
  - plots used in `html` report are stored in `dataset_report_label_G4_positives_vs_G4_negatives_plots` folder in `png` format

Simple and html reports are generated by default. You can change types of generated reports with `report_types` argument. Supported values are `simple`, `html` and `json`. Json report contains dump of all computed statistics about dataset.

You can preview generated HTML report on GitHub using [htmlpreview](https://github.com/htmlpreview/htmlpreview.github.com) tool by prepending URL of any HTML file with `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?`:
